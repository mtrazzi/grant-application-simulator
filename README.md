Disclaimer: all of the screenshot or examples in this repository use simulations of what people might say about grant proposals or other text, but do not represent these poeple's views. These are only predictions generated by language models based on limited [data](src/prompts).

## Features

Three main features:
- Grantmaking Advice: simulates feedback from grantmakers (summarized, then full feedback).
- Research Methodology Advice: Alignment Researchers criticize methodology.
- Grantmaker Debate Simulation: debate between two grantmakers.

## Requirements

Requires an Anthropic API key (get one [here]([url](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/getting-started))).

## Installation and Debug Guide

For issues with the Anthropic API key, use the "Reset API Key" command to set a new key.

## Known Issues

Answers are sometimes truncated.

Response time are long (more than 10 seconds), and the request timeouts are not perfectly handled.
